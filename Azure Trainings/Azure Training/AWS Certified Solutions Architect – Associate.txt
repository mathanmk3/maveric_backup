Networking
Be sure to create VPC from scratch. This is mandatory.
Create VPC and understand whats an CIDR and addressing patterns
Create public and private subnets, configure proper routes, security groups, NACLs. (hint: Subnets are public or private depending on whether they can route traffic directly through Internet gateway)
Create Bastion for communication with instances
Create NAT Gateway or Instances for instances in private subnets to interact with internet
Create two tier architecture with application in public and database in private subnets
Create three tier architecture with web servers in public, application and database servers in private. (hint: focus on security group configuration with least privilege)
Make sure to understand how the communication happens between Internet, Public subnets, Private subnets, NAT, Bastion etc.
Understand difference between Security Groups and NACLs (hint: Security Groups are Stateful vs NACLs are stateless. Also only NACLs provide an ability to deny or block IPs)
Understand VPC endpoints and what services it can help interact (hint: VPC Endpoints routes traffic internally without Internet)
VPC Gateway Endpoints supports S3 and DynamoDB.
VPC Interface Endpoints OR Private Links supports others
Understand difference between NAT Gateway and NAT Instance (hint: NAT Gateway is AWS managed and is scalable and highly available)
Understand how NAT high availability can be achieved (hint: provision NAT in each AZ and route traffic from subnets within that AZ through that NAT Gateway)
Understand VPN and Direct Connect for on-premises to AWS connectivity
VPN provides quick connectivity, cost-effective, secure channel, however routes through internet and does not provide consistent throughput
Direct Connect provides consistent dedicated throughput without Internet, however requires time to setup and is not cost-effective
Understand Data Migration techniques
Choose Snowball vs Snowmobile vs Direct Connect vs VPN depending on the bandwidth available, data transfer needed, time available, encryption requirement, one-time or continuous requirement
Snowball, SnowMobile are for one-time data, cost-effective, quick and ideal for huge data transfer
Direct Connect, VPN are ideal for continuous or frequent data transfers
Understand CloudFront as CDN and the static and dynamic caching it provides, what can be its origin (hint: CloudFront can point to on-premises sources and its usecases with S3 to reduce load and cost)
Understand Route 53 for routing
Understand Route 53 health checks and failover routing
Understand  Route 53 Routing Policies it provides and their use cases mainly for high availability (hint: focus on weighted, latency, geolocation, failover routing)
Be sure to cover ELB concepts in deep.
SAA-C02 focuses on ALB and NLB and does not cover CLB
Understand differences between  CLB vs ALB vs NLB
ALB is layer 7 while NLB is layer 4
ALB provides content based, host based, path based routing
ALB provides dynamic port mapping which allows same tasks to be hosted on ECS node
NLB provides low latency and ability to scale
NLB provides static IP address


Security
Understand IAM as a whole
Focus on IAM role (hint: can be used for EC2 application access and Cross-account access)
Understand IAM identity providers and federation and use cases
Understand MFA and how would implement two factor authentication for an application
Understand IAM Policies (hint: except couple of questions with policies defined and you need to select correct statements)
Understand encryption services
KMS for key management and envelope encryption
Focus on S3 with SSE, SSE-C, SSE-KMS
Know SQS now provides SSE support 
AWS WAF integrates with CloudFront to provide protection against Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. It also provide IP blocking and geo-protection.
AWS Shield integrates with CloudFront to provide protection against DDoS.
Refer Disaster Recovery whitepaper, be sure you know the different recovery types with impact on RTO/RPO.


Storage
Understand various storage options S3, EBS, Instance store, EFS, Glacier, FSx and what are the use cases and anti patterns for each
Instance Store
Understand Instance Store (hint: it is physically attached  to the EC2 instance and provides the lowest latency and highest IOPS)
Elastic Block Storage – EBS
Understand various EBS volume types and their use cases in terms of IOPS and throughput. SSD for IOPS and HDD for throughput
Understand Burst performance and I/O credits to handle occasional peaks
Understand EBS Snapshots (hint: backups are automated, snapshots are manual) 
Simple Storage Service – S3
Cover S3 in depth
Understand S3 storage classes with lifecycle policies
Understand the difference between SA Standard vs SA IA vs SA IA One Zone in terms of cost and durability
Understand S3 Data Protection (hint: S3 Client side encryption encrypts data before storing it in S3)
Understand S3 features including
S3 provides a cost effective static website hosting
S3 versioning provides protection against accidental overwrites and deletions
S3 Pre-Signed URLs for both upload and download provides access without needing AWS credentials
S3 CORS allows cross domain calls
S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket.
Understand Glacier as an archival storage with various retrieval patterns
Glacier Expedited retrieval now allows object retrieval within mins
Understand Storage gateway and its different types.
Cached Volume Gateway provides access to frequently accessed data, while using AWS as the actual storage
Stored Volume gateway uses AWS as a backup, while the data is being stored on-premises as well
File Gateway supports SMB protocol
Understand FSx easy and cost effective to launch and run popular file systems.
FSx provides two file systems to choose from: Amazon FSx for Windows File Server for business applications and Amazon FSx for Lustre for high-performance workloads.
Understand the difference between EBS vs S3 vs EFS
EFS provides shared volume across multiple EC2 instances, while EBS can be attached to a single volume within the same AZ.
Understand the difference between EBS vs Instance Store
Would recommend referring Storage Options whitepaper, although a bit dated 90% still holds right


Compute
Understand Elastic Cloud Compute – EC2
Understand Auto Scaling and ELB, how they work together to provide High Available and Scalable solution. (hint: Span both ELB and Auto Scaling across Multi-AZs to provide High Availability)
Understand EC2 Instance Purchase Types – Reserved, Scheduled Reserved, On-demand and Spot and their use cases
Choose Reserved Instances for continuous persistent load
Choose Scheduled Reserved Instances for load with fixed scheduled and time interval
Choose Spot instances for fault tolerant and Spiky loads
Reserved instances provides cost benefits for long terms requirements over On-demand instances
Spot instances provides cost benefits for temporary fault tolerant spiky load
Understand EC2 Placement Groups (hint: Cluster placement groups provide low latency and high throughput communication, while Spread placement group provides high availability)
Understand Lambda and serverless architecture, its features and use cases. (hint: Lambda integrated with API Gateway to provide a serverless, highly scalable, cost-effective architecture)
Understand ECS with its ability to deploy containers and micro services architecture.
ECS role for tasks can be provided through taskRoleArn
ALB provides dynamic port mapping to allow multiple same tasks on the same node
Know Elastic Beanstalk at a high level, what it provides and its ability to get an application running quickly.


Databases
Understand relational and NoSQLs data storage options which include RDS, DynamoDB, Aurora and their use cases
RDS
Understand RDS features – Read Replicas vs Multi-AZ
Read Replicas for scalability, Multi-AZ for High Availability
Multi-AZ are regional only
Read Replicas can span across regions and can be used for disaster recovery
Understand Automated Backups, underlying volume types
Aurora
Understand Aurora
provides multiple read replicas and replicates 6 copies of data across AZs
Understand Aurora Serverless provides a highly scalable cost-effective database solution
DynamoDB
Understand DynamoDB with its low latency performance, key-value store (hint: DynamoDB is not a relational database)
DynamoDB DAX provides caching for DynamoDB

Know Kinesis for real time data capture and analytics
Atleast know what AWS Glue does, so you can eliminate the answer


Management Tools
Understand CloudWatch monitoring to provide operational transparency
Know which EC2 metrics it can track. Remember, it cannot track memory and disk space/swap utilization
Understand CloudWatch is extendable with custom metrics
Understand CloudTrail for Audit
